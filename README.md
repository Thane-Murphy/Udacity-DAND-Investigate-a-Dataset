# Investigate A dataset Project 1

# Dataset
In this analysis, we aim to explore various factors influencing patient attendance at medical appointments. By delving into a dataset containing information on patient demographics, medical conditions, appointment scheduling, and attendance status, we seek to address several key questions. These questions include investigating the impact of receiving SMS reminders on appointment attendance, assessing whether certain days of the week are associated with higher attendance rates, examining the relationship between age and appointment attendance, and exploring potential correlations between medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Through this exploration, we aim to gain insights into the factors driving patient attendance behavior and identify potential areas for targeted interventions to improve appointment adherence and overall healthcare outcomes.

# Summary of Findings
The analysis of the data uncovers crucial insights into the determinants of appointment attendance. Although SMS reminders demonstrate a noticeable effect on reducing no-show rates, it is evident that additional factors such as age, day of the week, and underlying health conditions exert considerable influence. Ensuring equitable comparisons through adjusted sample sizes underscores the significance of accounting for diverse variables concurrently. Furthermore, the correlation matrix illuminates the intricate relationships among these factors, presenting avenues for tailored interventions aimed at bolstering attendance rates. In essence, a comprehensive strategy that addresses multiple dimensions, encompassing SMS reminders alongside demographic characteristics, is imperative for enhancing appointment attendance and optimizing the delivery of healthcare services.
